Assumptions made:

Working:

1. Customer opens the app.2. They then login/register to the app.3. Then the user will be landed on the Bike renting page where they can select their preferred location on the map.
4. The user will then be re-directed to the next page where they have to select their bicycle type. The prices for each vary according to the bicycle type selected.5. The user will enter their credit card details to make the payment and order their bicycle. On this screen, an option has been provided to the user to see their credit card purchase history with the app.6. After the transaction is authenticated and approved from the server, the user can go and collect the bicycle from the selected location.7. Bike renting Service is happy to help..:D.
